Either route will create the branch on GitHub and set it as the default upstream for future `git push` / `git pull`.

### (Optional but recommended) tidy-ups before the first push

1. **Add a `.gitignore`** so the repository isnâ€™t bloated by build artifacts and executables. For a PyQt + PyInstaller project, something like:

   ```gitignore
   # Python
   __pycache__/
   *.py[cod]
   *.pyd
   # Build / dist folders
   build/
   dist/
   *.spec
   # IDE / OS clutter
   .vscode/
   *.DS_Store
